basic dns request tcp
    ${PORT1}    ${PORT2}=      Reflect traffic between ports using `TCP´
    ${connection1}=   Open TCP connection to server `127.0.0.1´ on port `${PORT1}´
    ${connection2}=   Open TCP connection to server `127.0.0.1´ on port `${PORT2}´
    Write binary data generated from `${exampleRequestRoboconTcp}´ using construct `${dns_payload_tcp}´ to `${connection1}`
